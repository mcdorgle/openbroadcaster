# OpenBroadcaster Installer

This folder contains the Inno Setup script and build tools for creating the OpenBroadcaster Windows installer.

## Prerequisites

1. **Inno Setup 6.x** - Download from [jrsoftware.org](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php)
2. **.NET 8 SDK** - For building the application

## Building the Installer

### Important: Distribution & Licensing

The contents of this repository (source code, scripts, and documentation) are
licensed under the MIT license. **The compiled Windows installer that you
produce with this script is not free/open software and is not licensed for
public redistribution from this repository.**

Use the generated installer only for your own testing or according to the
separate terms under which you obtain an official installer.

### Option 1: Use the batch file (Recommended)

Simply run:
```batch
build-installer.bat
```

This will:
1. Build OpenBroadcaster in Release mode (self-contained)
2. Create the installer using Inno Setup
3. Output to `bin\InstallerOutput\`

### Option 2: Manual build

1. First, publish the application:
   ```powershell
   cd E:\openbroadcaster
   dotnet publish OpenBroadcaster.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true -o "bin\Installer"
   ```

2. Then compile the installer script:
   ```batch
   "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" OpenBroadcaster.iss
   ```
