## Website & Full Documentation

- Product website: https://openbroadcaster.org
- Online docs & guides: https://openbroadcaster.org/docs/

The docs folder in this repository mirrors the online documentation. The
step‑by‑step user guide lives under `docs/user-guide` and is organized from
"Getting Started" through automation, web integration, and troubleshooting.

## Quick Start (First-Time User)

This section is for someone who has never used OpenBroadcaster before and just
installed it on Windows.

### 1. Install & Launch

1. Run `OpenBroadcaster-Setup.exe` and complete the wizard.
2. Start **OpenBroadcaster** from the Start Menu or desktop shortcut.
3. On first launch, maximize the window so you can see the Library, Queue,
   Decks, and Cartwall clearly.

### 2. Configure Audio Devices

1. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon.
2. Open the **Audio** tab.
3. Set at minimum:
   - **Deck A Output**: your main speakers or headphones.
   - **Deck B Output**: usually the same as Deck A.
   - **Cart Wall Output**: same as Deck A/B unless you use a mixer.
   - **Encoder Input**: `Default` to stream what you hear, or a mixer input.
4. Click **Apply** / **Save**.

To test quickly: load any track to Deck A (double‑click from the Library) and
press **Play** or hit **Spacebar** — you should hear audio.

### 3. Add Your Music Library

1. Click **Library** in the left sidebar.
2. Choose **Add Folder** and select one or more folders that contain music.
3. Wait for the scan to finish; tracks will appear in the Library list with
   Title, Artist, Album, Duration, etc.
4. Use the search box above the list to find songs by title/artist/album.

You can also drag folders from Windows Explorer directly into the Library
panel to add and scan them.

### 4. Organize with Categories (Recommended)

Categories make AutoDJ and rotations work well.

1. Select one or more tracks in the Library.
2. Right‑click → **Assign Categories**.
3. Tick existing categories or create new ones like:
   - "Music", "Jingles", "Promos", "IDs".
   - Genre‑based ("Rock", "Pop", "Country"…).
4. Save your changes.

You can manage categories and watch folders in **Settings → Library**.

### 5. Build a Simple Queue & Play

1. In the Library, right‑click tracks and choose **Add to Queue**, or drag
   them into the **Queue** panel.
2. Make sure **Deck A** is empty or stopped.
3. Double‑click any queued item to load it into Deck A.
4. Press **Play** (or Spacebar) to start your first track.
5. Enable **Auto Advance** in the Queue/Deck options so the next queued track
   loads automatically when one finishes.

Basic keyboard shortcuts:
- `Spacebar` – Play/Pause Deck A
- `Shift + Space` – Play/Pause Deck B
- `Q` – Add selected track to queue
- `Delete` – Remove selected item from queue

### 6. Use AutoDJ (Optional but Powerful)

AutoDJ keeps the queue topped up using your category rules.

1. Open **Settings → AutoDJ**.
2. Create or edit a rotation:
   - Add slots that reference categories (e.g., Music → Jingle → Music).
   - Set separation rules (minimum time between same artist/title).
3. Set a **Target Queue Depth** (e.g., 10 items).
4. Turn on **AutoDJ** from the toolbar.

OpenBroadcaster will now automatically add songs to the queue whenever it
falls below the target depth.

### 7. Configure Streaming (Going Live)

If you have an Icecast/Shoutcast or hosted stream account:

1. Get these details from your provider: server address/host, port, mount
   point (Icecast), and source password.
2. In OpenBroadcaster, go to **Settings → Encoder**.
3. Click **Add Profile** and enter:
   - Profile name (e.g., "Main Stream 128k").
   - Server type (Icecast 2 or Shoutcast).
   - Server address, port, and mount point (Icecast).
   - Password (source password).
   - Format and bitrate (e.g., MP3 128 kbps, 44.1 kHz, Stereo).
4. Save the profile.
5. Open the **Encoder** panel, select your profile, and click
   **Start Encoding**.

When status shows **Connected**, your stream is live. Listen via your
streaming URL in a browser or media player to confirm.

### 8. Connect Twitch (Song Requests)

1. Go to **Settings → Twitch**.
2. Click **Connect** and complete the browser authorization.
3. Configure request pricing, cooldowns, and loyalty points.
4. Enable the Twitch chat bridge.

Viewers can then use chat commands like `!s <term>`, `!1`–`!9`, `!np`, and
`!next` to search, request songs, and see now playing info.

### 9. Web & WordPress Integration (Optional)

If you run a website or WordPress site, you can expose your now playing
metadata, queue, and requests:

1. Decide on **Direct mode** (built‑in web server on your PC) or
   **Relay mode** (a separate relay service for NAT‑safe setups).
2. For WordPress, copy the plugin from `wordpress-plugin-v2/` into your
   WordPress `wp-content/plugins` folder and activate **OpenBroadcaster Web**.
3. In WordPress → **Settings → OpenBroadcaster**, configure:
   - Direct or Relay mode connection.
   - The URL of your OpenBroadcaster Direct server or Relay.
   - Optional API key.
4. Use shortcodes like `[ob_now_playing]`, `[ob_library]`, `[ob_request]`,
   `[ob_queue]`, or `[ob_full_page]` on your site.

Detailed instructions for Direct, Relay, and all shortcodes are in
`docs/user-guide/09-web-integration.txt` and on the website docs.

### 10. Overlays for OBS/Streaming

1. In OpenBroadcaster, go to **Settings → Overlay** and enable **Overlay
   Server**.
2. Note the overlay URL (typically `http://localhost:9750`).
3. In OBS, add a **Browser Source** using this URL and size/position it in
   your scene.

The overlay shows now playing info, artwork, history, and current requests in
real time.
