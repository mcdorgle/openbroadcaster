### 📋 Unified Queue System
- **Multiple Sources**: Accept tracks from manual drops, AutoDJ, clockwheel scheduler, and Twitch requests
- **Priority Management**: Visual attribution showing source (Manual, AutoDJ, Request) and requester info

### 🎛️ Audio Routing
- **Multi-bus Architecture**: Separate program, encoder, and cue buses
- **Device Selection**: Choose specific audio devices for playback, microphone, and cue output
- **Routing Rules**:
  - Decks → Program + Encoder buses
  - Cartwall → Program + Encoder buses

- **MP3 Encoding**: LAME encoder at configurable bitrates (default 256 kbps)
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Secure streaming connections
- **Auto-reconnect**: Exponential backoff reconnection on network failures
- **Metadata Injection**: Now-playing information sent to stream servers
- **Per-profile Settings**: Independent configuration for each stream target

### 💬 Twitch Integration

  | Command | Description |
  |---------|-------------|
  | `!s <term>` | Search the music library |
  | `!1` - `!9` | Select from search results |
  | `!playnext <n>` | Priority request (front of queue) |
  | `!np` | Display now playing |
  | `!next` | Show next track in queue |
  | `!help` | List available commands |
- **Auto-reconnect**: Automatic recovery from network drops

### 🖥️ OBS Overlay & Data API

  - Next track preview
  - Last 5 played tracks (history)
  - Current request queue
- **Ready-to-use HTML/CSS/JS**: Included overlay templates for OBS browser sources
- **Low Latency**: ≤250ms data refresh

### ⚙️ Settings & Configuration
